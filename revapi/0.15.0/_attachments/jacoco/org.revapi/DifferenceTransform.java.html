/**
 * A difference transform may elect to transform certain kinds of differences into other kinds. This comes useful in
 * custom extensions that want to &quot;modify the behavior&quot; of other extensions by consuming and transforming the
 * differences found by the other extensions into something else.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@link #close()} is not called if there is no prior call to {@link #initialize(AnalysisContext)}. Do all your
 * resource acquisition in initialize, not during the construction of the object.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: for more complex transformations that require contextual knowledge about the traversal (like when you
 * need to employ an element matcher during the transformation), you may want to re-implement the default methods for
 * the element-pair tree traversal of the elements. The traversal happens prior to any transformations.
 *
 * @param &lt;E&gt;
 *            the type of the element expected in the {@code transform} method. Note that you need to be careful about
 *            this type because the types of the elements passed to {@code tryTransform} depend on the differences that
 *            the transform is interested in. Thus you may end up with {@code ClassCastException}s if you're not
 *            careful. This type needs to be cast-able to the type of all possible elements that the handled differences
 *            can apply to. If in doubt, just keep the type generic.
